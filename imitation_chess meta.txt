TODO:
  Theme change (without resetting game / calling __init__ again)
  Complex win condition
  custom board setup
  bitmaps for board/menu instead of raw colors

Already Done:
  Board setup
  Pieces in place
  Cell selection
  Move pieces - drag and drop
  Removing pieces
  Pawn moving 2 steps from starting position
  Only let piece move if it's a valid move
  Castling
  Turns!
  Simple win condition (king was taken off)
  Themes
  Undo
  'store'/show taken-off pieces
  Pawn reaching end of board can change to be any piece
  'animation' of pieces moving to graveyard

Issues:
  Pawn can move forward 2 blocks and take off a piece
  Cannot undo a pawn replace operation
  The copy.deepcopy is causing many issues with pygame :(
  Changing theme is derped

Menu options:
  1-2 players
  Theme / color
  Piece type?

Potential Features I want in but will never be bothered to code:
  Create your own board-setup, theme, pieces
  Shoji pieces/rules
  IN 3-D (honest trailer phantom menace voice)
