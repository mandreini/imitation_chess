TODO:
  Win condition
  custom board setup
  better menu?
  AI for when I have all the time
  etc etc

Already Done:
  Board setup
  Pieces in place
  Cell selection
  Move pieces - drag and drop
  Removing pieces
  Pawn moving 2 steps from starting position
  Only let piece move if it's a valid move
  Castling
  Turns!
  Themes

Issues:
  Pawn can move forward 2 blocks and take off a piece
  Undo - copy.deepcopy makes pygame cry for some unknown reason
  copy.deepcopy still gives a pointer/reference and thus board.undo is broken

Menu options:
  1-2 players
  Theme / color
  Piece type?

Potential Features I want in but will never be bothered to code:
  Create your own board-setup, theme, pieces
  Shoji pieces/rules
  IN 3-D (honest trailer phantom menace voice)
